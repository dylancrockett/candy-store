This is a project to demo a basic shopping cart system using React and Redux + Typescript. There is basic account functionality (register & login) but no way of checking out or placing an order. This project utilizes a PostgreSQL database for storing user account, product category, and individual item information but the database schema is not available in this repo. If you would like that information please contact me directly or open an issue.
